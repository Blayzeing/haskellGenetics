NEW PLAN:

Instead of moving individual cards from cols to cols etc,

Only move an individual card when it's a head;
	---> This is a more specialised form of a general movement algorithm:
		
		- Move king sequences if they can be moved
		- For a board, find needed cards (as is done)
		- For every needed card in the columns at any point, calculate it's sequence (ie, the list of cards following this card that are predeccessors)
		- If the sequence ends at the column head *AND* it's shorter than or equal to (length reserve -1), the move it.
			IF NOT SHORTER: Do nothing, it is not a sensible move at all.
			IF NOT AT HEAD: Make this move the move of removing a card from the head of the column to clear way for the sequence. Rank by move heuristic.
	
	NOTE:
	Maybe king sequences are also described by this algorithm, if and only if, the length of cols is less than 8 and the new move is to a new column
	

TOOO DOOOO:
Re-implement wanted cards [DONE]

- Change broken sequence check and replace with attempted removal of the covering sequence
