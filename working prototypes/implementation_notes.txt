findMoves
	- A findKingMoves()
	- A convertToMoves() that takes a list of card positions (and maybe
	  goal positions) and converts them to moves (basically, for every
	  card, if it's a head or a reserve, move it to the correct goal col;
	  if not, then move the head of it's col to reserves. If the reserve
	  move cannot be made, then do not make the move. Note that this will
	  return the board in the same state. This will allow for a filter to
	  be applied to the list of moves to remove any that result in a state
	  that is the same as the current state.)
